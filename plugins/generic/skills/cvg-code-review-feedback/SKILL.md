# Code Review Feedback

Use this skill in the worker session after a code reviewer returns blocker
findings.

The input is the reviewer blocker findings appended to the prompt, plus the
accepted plan, behavior contract if present, implementation notes, base/head
refs, current diff, and relevant changed files.

Do not treat reviewer findings as a patch list. First decide whether each finding
is an implementation-owned issue under the accepted plan and contract. Workers
must stop for plan gaps, contract gaps, and systemic design gaps.

If the task context provides no coordination channel (standalone use), the
coordination channel is the user: stop and ask directly.

## Process

### 1. Reload implementation authority

Read:

- accepted plan and "done when" criteria,
- behavior contract or linked design notes, if present,
- implementation notes,
- current diff and changed files,
- exact reviewer blocker findings.

### 2. Evaluate each blocker

For each finding, decide whether it is:

- **Local code bug**: accepted behavior is clear, and implementation is wrong in
  a bounded place.
- **Pattern bug**: the same implementation mistake may appear across adjacent
  surfaces covered by the accepted plan.
- **Verification gap**: implementation may be correct, but required proof from
  the accepted plan is missing.
- **Plan gap**: the reviewer exposed a missing surface, invariant, slice, matrix
  cell, or gate that the plan does not define.
- **Contract gap**: expected behavior is not defined well enough to patch safely.
- **Systemic design gap**: the architecture, ownership, state model, or protocol
  assumptions are insufficient for a worker patch.
- **Reviewer clarification needed**: the finding cannot be mapped to concrete
  evidence after re-reading the relevant context.
- **Invalid or out of scope**: the finding is stale, already fixed, contradicts
  the accepted plan, or is outside the implementation scope.

### 3. Repair only worker-owned issues

For local code bugs, pattern bugs, and implementation-owned verification gaps:

- add or update the required regression test or verification gate first,
- repair the implementation,
- for pattern bugs, audit adjacent planned surfaces and report what was checked,
- update implementation notes when the feedback reveals a deviation, assumption,
  or audited pattern the reviewer needs to know.

For plan gaps, contract gaps, and systemic design gaps:

- stop and callback through the coordination channel,
- state the missing plan or contract decision,
- do not edit plans, contracts, surface matrices, acceptance criteria, or scope,
- do not continue implementation until the planner or coordination channel
  resolves the gap.

For reviewer clarification:

- callback with the exact ambiguity and evidence checked.

For invalid or out-of-scope findings:

- keep code unchanged for that finding,
- explain why it does not apply.

## Output

Before editing, write a compact intake summary:

```text
Code review feedback intake:
1. Finding: <reviewer finding id or short quote>
   Decision: <local code bug / pattern bug / verification gap / plan gap / contract gap / systemic design gap / clarification needed / invalid or out of scope>
   Action: <repair / audit and repair / add verification / stop for planner / ask reviewer / no change>
   Evidence: <plan/code/test reference>
```

After acting, report:

- findings repaired,
- tests or verification gates added or run,
- adjacent surfaces audited for pattern bugs,
- findings rejected or needing clarification,
- plan, contract, or systemic gaps that stopped implementation.

## Rules

- Do not edit plans, behavior contracts, surface matrices, acceptance criteria, or
  scope.
- Do not patch through missing behavior decisions.
- Do not continue implementation after identifying a plan, contract, or systemic
  design gap.
- Do not silently drop invalid or out-of-scope findings.
